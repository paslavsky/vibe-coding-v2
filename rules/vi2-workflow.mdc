vi2-workflow:

- The .vi2/ directory contains vi2 workflow artifacts: tasks.md (execution checklist), llm_context.md (knowledge snapshot), and questions.md (decision dialogue).
- Every task must leave the project in a stable state: code builds and tests pass.
- Never modify completed tasks ([x]) in tasks.md. History is immutable.
- When encountering ambiguity, raise a question in questions.md instead of guessing.
- The user's code is the single source of truth. Artifacts adapt to code, not the other way around.
